# IPAM Support Enhancement - PR Description

## Summary

This PR enhances the Azure Virtual Network Terraform module with comprehensive IPAM (IP Address Management) support while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing traditional VNet configurations.

## Type of Change

- [x] âœ¨ New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ðŸ§¹ Code cleanup/refactoring
- [x] ðŸ“š Documentation update

## Changes Made

### Core Functionality
- [x] Added lifecycle precondition in `subnet/main.tf` to validate subnet configuration
- [x] Enhanced input validation to ensure either `cidrs` or `ip_address_pool` is provided
- [x] Improved error handling for invalid subnet configurations

### Examples & Documentation
- [x] Updated IPAM example configurations for consistency
- [x] Enhanced inline code comments explaining placeholder `address_space` usage
- [x] Added comprehensive `VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` documentation
- [x] Improved variable descriptions and formatting

### Testing & Validation
- [x] Validated with `terraform validate` on all configurations
- [x] Verified backward compatibility with existing traditional VNets
- [x] Tested new IPAM-only functionality scenarios
- [x] Validated mixed traditional + IPAM hybrid scenarios

## IPAM Support Enhancement

### Functionality Validated
- [x] **Traditional VNet**: Existing `address_space` + `cidrs` configurations work unchanged
- [x] **IPAM-Only VNet**: Pure IPAM pool allocation functionality works correctly
- [x] **Mixed VNet**: Hybrid traditional + IPAM scenarios supported
- [x] **Input Validation**: Lifecycle preconditions properly enforce requirements

### Usage Patterns Supported
- [x] Traditional mode: `cidrs` only, no `ip_address_pool`
- [x] IPAM mode: `ip_address_pool` only, no `cidrs`
- [x] Hybrid mode: Both `cidrs` and `ip_address_pool` for complex scenarios

### Configuration Requirements
- [x] Confirmed `names` variable includes all required fields (`resource_group_type`)
- [x] Verified placeholder `address_space` handling for IPAM scenarios (`0.0.0.0/8`)
- [x] Validated lifecycle precondition logic: `length(var.cidrs) > 0 || var.ip_address_pool != null`

## Breaking Changes

- [x] No breaking changes

**Details:**
All existing traditional VNet configurations continue to work without any modifications. The module maintains full backward compatibility while adding new IPAM capabilities.

## Backward Compatibility

- [x] âœ… **Confirmed**: All existing configurations continue to work without modification

**Compatibility Details:**
- Traditional VNets with explicit `address_space` and subnet `cidrs` function identically to previous versions
- No changes required to existing Terraform configurations
- New IPAM functionality is opt-in and doesn't affect existing deployments

## Testing Performed

### Validation Tests
- [x] `terraform init` - successful on all configurations
- [x] `terraform validate` - passed on all examples and test scenarios
- [x] `terraform fmt` - applied consistently across all files
- [x] Lifecycle preconditions - validated logic and error messages

### Example Configurations Tested
- [x] `examples/basic/` - Traditional VNet functionality (no regressions)
- [x] `examples/ipam_pool/` - Mixed traditional + IPAM functionality  
- [x] `examples/ipam_only/` - Pure IPAM functionality
- [x] Invalid configurations - Properly rejected by lifecycle preconditions

### Provider Compatibility
- [x] Tested with Azure provider version: `~> 4.0`
- [x] Confirmed compatibility with Terraform version requirements

## Key Features Added

### 1. Lifecycle Precondition Validation
```hcl
lifecycle {
  precondition {
    condition     = length(var.cidrs) > 0 || var.ip_address_pool != null
    error_message = "Either 'cidrs' must be provided or 'ip_address_pool' must be configured for IPAM allocation."
  }
}
```

### 2. Flexible Configuration Support
- **Traditional**: `cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24"]`
- **IPAM-Only**: `ip_address_pool = "/subscriptions/.../ipamPools/pool-example"`
- **Hybrid**: Both `cidrs` and `ip_address_pool` for complex scenarios

### 3. Placeholder Address Space Handling
For pure IPAM scenarios where address space will be dynamically allocated:
```hcl
address_space = ["0.0.0.0/8"]  # Placeholder - replaced by IPAM allocation
```

## Files Modified

- **`subnet/main.tf`**: Added lifecycle precondition for input validation
- **`examples/ipam_only/main.tf`**: Formatting consistency and improved comments
- **`examples/ipam_pool/main.tf`**: Code formatting improvements
- **`examples/ipam_pool/variables.tf`**: Updated default values
- **`VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`**: Comprehensive validation documentation

## Additional Context

This enhancement enables the module to support Azure Network Manager IPAM pools while preserving all existing functionality. The implementation anticipates future Azure provider updates that will include `azurerm_network_manager_ipam_pool_static_cidr` resources.

The placeholder `address_space` approach is a temporary workaround for current Azure provider limitations and will be refined as the provider evolves.
